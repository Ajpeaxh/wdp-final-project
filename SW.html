				There are three most common types of Keyboard switches namely,<br>Linear Switches<br>Clicky Switches<br>and Tactile Switches<br><br><br>

				<b>Linear Switches</b><br><br>
				Commonly known as the red switch. Linear switches usually feel smooth and offer a consistent actuation <br>
				without any tactile feedback. The actuation or the registering of a keypress happens when <br>
				it bottoms out, and since there are no bumps in between, linear switches glide down rather easily.<br>
				Many gamers prefer investing in keyboards with linear switches, with the most common one being <br>
				Cherry MX Red.<br><br><br>

				<b>Clicky Switches</b>
				Commonly known as the blue switch. Clicky switches follow the same concept as tactile switches, which means<br>
				they're bumpy, but at the same time, they are louder by design. These key switches offer a bump<br>
				along with additional audio feedback, which is pretty satisfying, almost like an old typewriter.<br>
				However, this can be annoying for people around you, especially in an office environment. If you like<br>
				having a nice clicky keyboard, you could look at Cherry MX Blue switches.<br><br><br>

				<b>Tactile Switches</b>
				Commonly known as the brown switch. Tactile switches have a similar construction as linear but<br>
				include a bump halfway through the key’s downward travel. This bump signifies the actuation point,<br>
				which means that a keypress is registered before it fully bottoms out. This enables a faster typing experience<br>
				since the key doesn’t have to travel all the way down to actuate, thus becoming the preferred choice of typists.<br>
				Cherry MX Brown switches are one of the most popular among the variety of tactile keyboard switches available<br>
				in the market.
