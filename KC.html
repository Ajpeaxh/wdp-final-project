				<b>Keycap Material</b><br><br>
				There are two main materilas used for keycaps. The ABS and PBT.<br>
				ABS keycaps are the cheapest and most common plastic used for keycaps.<br>
				ABS keycaps are mass produced because of how easily they are injection molded.<br>
				PBT plastic is less common but is usually higher quality than ABS. ABS keycaps <br>
				feel smooth and develop a greasy shine over time, while PBT keycaps feel textured<br>
				and are more durable. <br><br>
				PBT are considered superior to ABS since they are more durable<br>
				and wear down less over time. That being said, there are some really nice ABS keycap<br>
				sets available, and at the end of the day it comes down to user preference. Some people<br>
				prefer the smooth feel of ABS while others like the textured feel of PBT.<br><br><br>

				<b>Keycap Profiles</b><br><br>
				One of the biggest differences between keycap profiles is whether the keycaps are<br>
				sculpted or uniform. A uniform keycap has a flat surface and is not angled at all.<br>
				Sculpted keycaps on the other hand, have a slight angle to help with typing to make<br>
				is so you donâ€™t need to stretch your fingers quite as far.<br><br>
				Sculpted is usually preferred by most people, as it makes typing feel more fluid but<br>
				others may find the uniform profile feels or looks better for them. The uniform profile<br>
				it typically found on enthusiast keycap sets with unique designs.<br><br><br>
